# Car-rental-system
The Vehicle Rental Management System is a C++-based application designed to streamline the process of selecting and renting two-wheeler vehicles based on user preferences. This system allows users to input and choose physical and engine-related specifications such as color, brand, model, fuel capacity, engine capacity, and horsepower. The software calculates an estimated rental cost based on selected features and brand value. In addition, it collects essential customer information including name, address, contact number, and rental duration. By combining class inheritance and structured data handling, the system models real-world rental interactions with an emphasis on modularity and ease of expansion. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction to simulate a simplified yet functional rental service for two-wheelers.

It demonstrates Object Oriented Concepts such as:

1. Class Inheritance
2. Use of Constructors
3. Operator Overloading
